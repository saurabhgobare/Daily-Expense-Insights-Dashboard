## Daily Expense Insights Dashboard | Personal Finance Analysis

# Project Overview
The Daily Expense Insights Dashboard is an interactive Power BI project designed to track, visualize, and analyze personal financial data. It helps users understand spending patterns, compare expenses by category and payment mode, and monitor both daily and monthly expenditures.

This dashboard provides actionable insights for effective personal finance management and budgeting.

# Dataset
Source: Created using a combination of realistic synthetic sample data and manually added entries to resemble actual personal expenses.
Columns:

Category â€“ Expense category (e.g., groceries, travel, utilities)
Payment Mode â€“ Payment method (e.g., cash, card, UPI)
Amount â€“ Expense amount
Cleaning: Dataset was structured and mostly clean. Only minor manual adjustments were required; no major cleaning was necessary before creating visuals.
