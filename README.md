## Daily Expense Insights Dashboard | Personal Finance Analysis

# Project Overview
The Daily Expense Insights Dashboard is a Power BI project designed to track, visualize, and analyze personal financial data.
It helps users understand spending patterns, compare expenses by category and payment mode, and monitor daily and monthly expenditures. 
This dashboard provides actionable insights for effective personal finance management.

# Dataset
•	Source: Created using a combination of realistic synthetic sample data and manually added entries to resemble actual personal expenses.
•	Columns:
1.	Date – Transaction date.
2.	Category – Expense category (e.g., groceries, travel, utilities).
3.	Payment Mode – Payment method (e.g., cash, card, UPI).
4.	Amount – Expense amount.
•	Cleaning: The dataset was structured and mostly clean; minor adjustments and additions were made manually, so no major cleaning was required before creating visuals.

# Dashboard Components
1.	Monthly Expense Trend (Trend Line Chart)
o	Shows how expenses fluctuate month to month.
2.	Category-wise Expense Distribution (Clustered Column Chart)
o	Displays Total Expense by category, helping compare spending across categories like groceries, travel, and utilities.
3.	Payment Mode Split (Donut Chart)
o	Visualizes Total Expense by payment mode, showing the distribution of cash, card, or UPI usage.
4.	Total Expense (Card)
o	Displays the Total Expense, representing the overall spending across all transactions.
5.	Month Slicer
o	Allows filtering of all visuals for a specific month, enabling dynamic and focused analysis.
6.	KPI Cards
o	Average Daily Expense – Shows the average daily spending for the selected month.
o	Total Selected Month Expense – Displays the Total Expense for the selected month.
7.	Category-wise Spend Analysis for Selected Month (Stacked Column Chart)
o	Shows Total and Average Expense per category for the selected month, allowing detailed category-level insights.
8.	Payment Mode Spend Analysis (Clustered Bar Chart)
o	Shows Total and Average Expense per payment mode for the selected month, helping monitor payment behavior.
9.	Drill-through: Payment Mode Analysis
o	A drill-through page is available for Payment Mode.
o	When a user selects a payment mode (e.g., UPI, Cash, Card) from the main dashboard, the drill-through view displays:
	Monthly Total Expenses by the selected Payment Mode.
o	This enables deep-dive analysis of spending behavior for each payment method.
